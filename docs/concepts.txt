Why is there no Subscriber-Model?
---------------------------------

I've tried to use a bunch of different Subscriber-Models bundled with the app
itself but none of them was usable for more than one use-case so I decided
to drop the concept of a Subscriber-Model and instead added a mechanism for
you to hook your own Subscriber (or User or whatever) model into the flow.

By adding a SubscriberList Object with a pointer to the ContentType of your
Model and by optionally adding lookup kwargs to narrow the selection you can
specifiy which objects of your model class for a list of subscribers. You
can even build SubscriberLists for different Models and send a Campaign in
one step to multiple SubscriberLists. 

Adding a SubscriberList for all active Users present in the django.contrib.auth
module one would simply add a SubscriberList object::

    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    from django.contrib.contenttypes.models import ContentType
    from campaing.models import SubscriberList
    
    obj = SubscriberList.objects.create(
                content_type=ContentType.objects.get_for_model(User), 
                filter_condition={'is_active': True}
            )
            
Of course this can also be done using Django's built-in admin interface.

Being alble to add any number and combinations of ContentTypes and lookup kwargs
and assining one or multiple SubscriberLists to a Campaign one should be able
to map any real-world scenario to the workflow. If a subscriber is present in
multiple SubscriberLists this is not a problem because the code makes sure
that every Campaign is only sent once to every given email address.
